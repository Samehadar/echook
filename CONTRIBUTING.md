   cd echook
   ```
2. **Create a branch** for your changes:

   ```
3. **Make your changes** and verify them locally (see Development Setup below).
4. **Commit** with a clear message following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: short description of your change"
   ```
5. **Push** and open a Pull Request against the `master` branch.

## Development Setup

echook keeps a **single canonical source** that is synced into the Claude Code plugin layout by a build script. Always edit the canonical files, never the `plugins/audio-hooks/` mirror.

### Repository layout

```
echook/
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
├── plugins/audio-hooks/              # plugin layout — MIRROR, populated by build-plugin.sh
│   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json

└── tests/                            # unittest suite (Cursor + Codex bridge contracts)
```

### Workflow

1. Edit canonical files (`/hooks/`, `/bin/`, `/audio/`, `/config/`, `/cursor-hooks/`, `/codex-hooks/`).
2. Run `bash scripts/build-plugin.sh` to sync into the plugin layout.
3. CI verifies in-sync via `bash scripts/build-plugin.sh --check`.
4. Validate: `claude plugin validate plugins/audio-hooks`.
5. Test: `python -m unittest discover -v tests` (Ubuntu/Windows/macOS × Python 3.9/3.12/3.13 in CI). **Not** pytest.
6. Bump version (when releasing): `bash scripts/bump-version.sh <new_version>` — atomically updates all canonical version locations and re-runs `build-plugin.sh`.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full system design, hook lifecycle, and how to add a new hook event or audio file.
