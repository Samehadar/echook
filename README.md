# echook

**AI-operated audio notification system for Claude Code, Cursor IDE, and Codex CLI.**<br/>
You type one slash command at install time. Then natural language forever.<br/>
Hear when your agent finishes, needs permission, or hits a rate limit — and pin a context-usage status line so you never lose your place.

<sub>**v6.2.0** — 39 hook events across all three editors · 2 audio themes · webhooks · TTS · rate-limit alerts · status line. Renamed `claude-code-audio-hooks` → **echook** (Echo + Hook) in 5.2.1; existing installs keep working. Full history in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).</sub>

> ## 🤖 This is an AI-Agent-first project — you don't read this, your agent does
>
> **Humans: don't install or configure echook by hand.** Point your AI agent — **Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex** — at this repo and say:
>
> > *"Install echook from `github.com/ChanMeng666/echook` and set it up for me."*
>
> Your agent reads the docs, runs every command, verifies the result, and reports back. The agent-facing source of truth is [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) + [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) + the live `audio-hooks manifest`. The only thing a human ever types by hand is one `/reload-plugins` slash command (Claude Code has no CLI equivalent for it).
>
> **All a human needs to know is what echook _does_** — skim [Key Features](#key-features) below — so you can ask your agent for it in plain English: *"mute audio for an hour"*, *"switch to chimes"*, *"watch my `.env` file"*, *"put a context-usage bar in my status line"*. Not sure what's possible? Just ask your agent **"what can I configure in echook?"**

## What's New

**Latest: v6.2.0 — complete hook coverage + per-tool-type sounds on Cursor.** 13 new lifecycle events (26 → 39 total): Claude Code's `Setup` / `UserPromptExpansion` / `PostToolBatch` / `MessageDisplay`, plus Cursor's **granular per-tool-type events** so shell commands, MCP calls, and file reads each get a *distinct* sound. All new events are opt-in.

Earlier highlights: **v6.1.0** pinned the Claude Code startup banner into the status line with auto-reflow · **v6.0.0** refocused echook to two tracks (audio/notification + status line) and made every operation a non-interactive CLI command.

📜 **Full version history → [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)** · [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ChanMeng666/echook/releases)

---

## Key Features

echook does exactly two things, and does them well: **(1)** tells you *what just happened* in your AI session when you're not watching the window — a sound at your desk, a spoken summary when you're away, a desktop toast or webhook when you're in another app — and **(2)** a **status line** that keeps the facts you need pinned to the bottom of the terminal.

### 🔔 Audio & out-of-band notifications

Hear (or get pinged) the moment your agent finishes, asks for permission, fails a tool, or hits a rate limit — so you can walk away and trust you'll be called back.

| Channel | What it's for |
|---|---|
| **Audio** | A sound at your desk the instant something needs you. Two themes — voice or chimes. |
| **Desktop toast** | A glanceable popup when you're in another window. |
| **TTS** | Speaks a sanitized summary of Claude's actual final message when you're away from the screen. |
| **Webhook** | Slack / Discord / Teams / ntfy / any HTTP endpoint — get alerts on your phone. |

### 📊 Status Line — startup-banner pin + context monitor

Pins your Claude Code startup banner at the bottom (so it never scrolls away) and adds real-time **context-window** and **quota** bars — color-coded warnings before Claude enters the "agent dumb zone". Auto-reflows to fit any terminal width, so nothing is truncated.

<p align="center">

```text
[Opus 4.8 (1M context)] | 🧠 high | ⚡ CC v2.1.193 | 📁 D:\…\claude-code-audio-hooks | echook v6.2.0 | 6/39 Sounds | Theme: Voice

```

| Color | Context used | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | < 50% | Safe — agent performs well | Keep working |
| 🟡 Yellow | 50–80% | Caution — entering the "dumb zone" | `/compact` or `/clear` soon |
| 🔴 Red | > 80% | Danger — frequent errors | `/compact` immediately |

<details>
<summary><kbd>29 customisable status-line segments</kbd></summary>
<br>

A few of the highlights (run `audio-hooks statusline segments` for the full live catalog):

| Segment | Shows |
|---|---|
| `model` | Model name (e.g. `[Opus 4.8 (1M context)]`) |
| `effort` / `thinking` | Reasoning effort (`🧠 high`) / extended-thinking flag |
| `cc_version` | Claude Code's own version (`⚡ CC v2.1.193`) |
| `cwd` / `repo` | Working directory / git remote `owner/name` |
| `session_name` / `agent` / `output_style` / `vim` | Session label / `--agent` name / output style / vim mode |
| `branch` / `git_dirty` / `worktree` | Git branch / uncommitted-change count / managed worktree |
| `pr` / `added_dirs` | Pull-request number + review state / `/add-dir` count |
| `api_quota` / `weekly_quota` | 5-hour & 7-day rate-limit bars + reset times |
| `context` / `tokens` / `exceeds_200k` | Context bar (+ tokens, `/compact` hint) / cache-hit ratio / >200K flag |
| `cost` / `duration` / `api_time` / `burn_rate` | Cost + lines diff / wall-clock time / API-wait share / $/hour |
| `version` · `sounds` · `webhook` · `theme` · `snooze` | echook version · sound count · webhook · audio theme · mute countdown |

Most richer segments self-omit when Claude Code doesn't supply their data, so a plain session stays clean. Pick segments with `visible_segments` (whitelist) or drop a few with `hidden_segments` (blacklist). Each logical line auto-reflows into as many rows as your terminal width needs — segments are never split, so nothing is cut off. Pin the width with `statusline_settings.max_width`.

> **Codex note:** Codex's status line is *not* command-backed — it only accepts a fixed list of built-in item IDs. echook can't render custom Codex segments, but it can **curate** the list so it stops truncating: `audio-hooks statusline codex apply --preset balanced`.

</details>

### 🎚️ More

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **39 hook events** | Full lifecycle coverage across Claude Code, Cursor & Codex — session start, tool use, permission requests, rate-limit warnings, and Cursor's granular shell/MCP/file events. 6 on by default; toggle any in plain English. |
| **2 audio themes** | `default` = ElevenLabs **Jessica** voice (*"Task completed"*) · `custom` = modern UI chimes. Say *"switch to chimes"*. |
| **Rate-limit alerts** | One-shot warning at 80% / 95% of your 5-hour or 7-day quota — warned once per threshold, never spammed. |
| **Webhooks** | Versioned `audio-hooks.webhook.v1` payload, fire-and-forget, never blocks a hook. |

## Get Started

This is an **AI-first** project — you don't follow install steps yourself. You tell your AI agent what to do in plain English, and it runs every command and reports back.

**Find your editor, paste the prompt into your agent, done:**

| Your editor / CLI | Tell your AI agent |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | *"Install the audio-hooks plugin from `github.com/ChanMeng666/echook`."* (Then type `/reload-plugins` once — the only manual step.) |
| **Cursor** (with Claude Code) | Nothing to install — Cursor 3.2.16+ auto-bridges the Claude Code plugin. *"Run `audio-hooks status` and confirm `editor_targets.cursor.state` is `bridged-via-claude-code`."* |
| **Cursor** (without Claude Code) | *"Clone `github.com/ChanMeng666/echook` into `~/audio-hooks`, run `python ~/audio-hooks/bin/audio-hooks install --cursor`, then verify with `audio-hooks status` + `audio-hooks test all`."* |
| **Codex** | *"Install the audio-hooks Codex plugin from `github.com/ChanMeng666/echook`, then verify with `audio-hooks status` + `audio-hooks test all`."* |

📖 **Full step-by-step install, upgrade, and verification for every path → [docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md).** Your agent reads this for you.

## Talk to It — Natural Language Control

Once installed (Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex — same CLI everywhere), every configuration is **one message**. You talk; your agent runs the right `audio-hooks` subcommand and reports back. You don't memorise anything.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor You as You
    participant CC as Your AI Agent

    rect rgb(219, 234, 254)
    Note over You,CC: Audio Theme
    You->>CC: Switch audio-hooks to the chime theme.
    CC-->>You: audio-hooks theme set custom — switched to chimes.
    end

    rect rgb(220, 252, 231)
    Note over You,CC: Snooze & Mute
    You->>CC: Snooze audio for 30 minutes.
    CC-->>You: audio-hooks snooze 30m — muted until 3:45 PM.
    You->>CC: Unmute audio.
    CC-->>You: audio-hooks snooze off — audio resumed.
    end

    rect rgb(254, 243, 199)
    Note over You,CC: Hook Selection
    You->>CC: Only fire on stop, notification, and<br/>permission_request — disable everything else.
    CC-->>You: enable-only stop notification permission_request<br/>— 3 hooks active, rest disabled.
    end

    rect rgb(207, 250, 254)
    Note over You,CC: Status Line & Webhooks
    You->>CC: Install the status line, context usage only.
    CC-->>You: statusline installed — visible segments: [context].
    You->>CC: Send alerts to my Slack webhook and test it.
    CC-->>You: Webhook set to slack format. Test delivered.
    end
```

A few examples — paraphrase freely:

- *"Switch to chimes"* / *"switch to voice"*
- *"Snooze audio for an hour"* / *"is audio muted?"*
- *"Enable rate-limit alerts at 80% and 95%"*
- *"Speak Claude's actual reply when done"*
- *"Watch my `.env` file for changes"*
- *"Different sound for shell commands vs MCP calls in Cursor"*
- *"Why isn't audio playing? Diagnose and fix it."*

    style AUDIO fill:#F5A623,color:#000
    style WH fill:#9013FE,color:#fff
    style LOG fill:#50E3C2,color:#000
```

Your editor fires hook events as JSON on stdin. Native matchers route each event to `hook_runner.py`, which checks snooze state, rate-limit thresholds, debounce, and user filters — then fires audio, desktop notifications, TTS, and webhooks as configured.

## Help, Uninstall & Documentation

> **Agents start here:** read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (mirrored as [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)) or [`llms.txt`](llms.txt), then run `audio-hooks manifest` — the complete, live, truthful state of the project. Everything below is for curious humans.

- **Something wrong?** Just say *"audio-hooks isn't working, diagnose and fix it"* — or see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
- **Uninstall?** Say *"uninstall audio-hooks completely."* Details in the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md).
- **Want to contribute?** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the canonical-source workflow.

**Design Philosophy** — This project is **AI-operated**, not AI-assisted. A typical CLI tool: the human learns the tool. **echook**: the human says what they want, and the AI agent learns the tool and does the work. The human is **upstream** of the agent, not downstream of the CLI.
