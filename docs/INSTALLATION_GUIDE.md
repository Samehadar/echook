# Installation Guide

> **Version:** 5.1.6 | **Last Updated:** 2026-05-02

The install is two slash commands inside Claude Code. This page is a pointer to the canonical install paths — there are no human-only steps to read through.

> **Upgrading from 5.1.4 or earlier?** Don't `/plugin uninstall + install` manually — that destroys your `user_preferences.json`. Run `audio-hooks upgrade` instead. It auto-detects the install scope, tries `claude plugin update` (data-preserving) first, and falls back to `uninstall --keep-data + install` if needed. Migration on next load merges any new template keys into your config without overwriting your customizations. Disaster recovery: `audio-hooks backup list` / `audio-hooks backup restore latest-external`.

## Recommended: plugin install

Inside Claude Code, run:

```text
/plugin marketplace add ChanMeng666/claude-code-audio-hooks
/plugin install audio-hooks@chanmeng-audio-hooks
```

Then verify and smoke-test:

```text
> run audio-hooks status
> run audio-hooks test all
```

That's it. All 26 hook events register, every audio file is bundled, and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/user_preferences.json` is auto-initialised on first read. The `/audio-hooks` SKILL ships with the plugin so you can configure everything via natural language afterwards.

## Alternative: legacy script install

For users who'd rather not use the plugin system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChanMeng666/claude-code-audio-hooks.git
cd claude-code-audio-hooks
bash scripts/install-complete.sh
```

The installer auto-engages non-interactive mode when stdin is not a TTY or `CLAUDE_NONINTERACTIVE=1` is set, so AI agents and CI can run it without prompts. For Windows native (PowerShell), use `.\scripts\install-windows.ps1`.

**Don't enable both paths** — they fire on every event independently and you'll hear double audio. `audio-hooks diagnose` reports `DUAL_INSTALL_DETECTED` if it finds both and tells you exactly how to fix it.

## Cursor IDE

The project ships AI-first install paths for Cursor IDE 3.2.16+. There are two of them; the right one depends on whether you also have Claude Code.

### Path A — Cursor + Claude Code (auto-bridge)

If you already have Claude Code on the same machine, run the recommended plugin install above. Cursor 3.2.16+ then auto-bridges every Claude Code plugin per [cursor.com/docs/reference/third-party-hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/third-party-hooks). Enable Cursor Settings → "Third-party skills" if not already on.

Verify by asking your agent:

```text
> run audio-hooks status
```

Expected: `editor_targets.cursor.state` == `bridged-via-claude-code`. 8 of 10 hook events bridge — `Notification` and `PermissionRequest` have no Cursor equivalent (per Cursor's docs) and stay silent under Cursor by design.

### Path B — Cursor without Claude Code (native install)

Paste a single prompt into Cursor's agent chat:

> *"Clone https://github.com/ChanMeng666/claude-code-audio-hooks into ~/audio-hooks, then run `python ~/audio-hooks/bin/audio-hooks install --cursor`. After it succeeds, restart Cursor."*

The `install --cursor` subcommand:

- Reads the canonical `cursor-hooks/hooks.json` template.
- Substitutes `{{PYTHON}}` and `{{HOOK_RUNNER}}` with absolute paths.
- Merges into `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (preserves any of your other Cursor hooks).
- Tags every entry with `_managed_by: "audio-hooks"` so uninstall is scope-safe.
- Seeds `~/.cursor/audio-hooks-data/user_preferences.json` from the bundled defaults.

It is fully non-interactive (no prompts, no menus) and idempotent (re-running does not duplicate entries).

The native install registers 11 Cursor-native event types — the 8 bridge-mapped events plus `subagentStart`, `postToolUseFailure`, and `afterFileEdit` (Cursor-only events with no Claude Code equivalent and so absent from the auto-bridge).

**`DUPLICATE_BRIDGE` guard:** if Claude Code's plugin is already installed, `install --cursor` aborts to prevent double audio. Pass `--force` only if you understand the trade-off.

### Upgrading the Cursor-only install

```bash
cd ~/audio-hooks && git pull && python bin/audio-hooks install --cursor
```

Re-running the install is idempotent and preserves `~/.cursor/audio-hooks-data/user_preferences.json`. There is no separate `audio-hooks upgrade --cursor` subcommand — `audio-hooks upgrade` targets Claude Code's plugin cache.

### Uninstalling the Cursor-only install

```bash
python ~/audio-hooks/bin/audio-hooks uninstall --cursor
```

Removes only entries tagged `_managed_by: "audio-hooks"` from `~/.cursor/hooks.json`. Preserves `~/.cursor/audio-hooks-data/user_preferences.json` so a future re-install picks up your settings. Pass `--purge` to delete that data dir as well.

## Lite tier (zero-dependency, no Python)

For users who want only desktop notifications + system sounds (no MP3s, no TTS, no webhooks):

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChanMeng666/claude-code-audio-hooks/master/scripts/quick-setup.sh | bash
```

Customise enabled hooks without cloning:

```bash
curl -sL .../quick-configure.sh | bash -s -- --list
curl -sL .../quick-configure.sh | bash -s -- --disable SubagentStop
curl -sL .../quick-configure.sh | bash -s -- --only Stop Notification
```

Uninstall:

```bash
curl -sL .../quick-unsetup.sh | bash
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Plugin install | Script install | Lite tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code v2.1.80+ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Python 3.6+ | ✓ (auto-detected, prefers `python3` then `python` then `py`) | ✓ | — |
| PowerShell (Windows) | ✓ (for audio playback) | ✓ | ✓ |
| `mpg123` / `ffplay` / `paplay` / `aplay` (Linux) | one of these | one of these | — |

## Verifying your install

```text
> run audio-hooks diagnose
```

Expected output for a healthy install: `ok: true`, `errors: []`, `warnings: []`, `audio_files: { present: 26, expected: 26 }`, `install: { script_install: ..., plugin_install: ... }` (exactly one of these `true`).

If anything is broken, the diagnose output includes a `suggested_command` for each error. Run that command.
